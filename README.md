# Discord Ticket Bot

This is an implemenation of a ticket bot system for Discord Servers. 

There are 2 files, one utilizes text commands, the other utilizes role reactions. In order to get this to work, you must modify all of the IDs and emoji names to fit your server's, and account for server emojis.

I coded this and uploaded a tutorial on YouTube, showing how I did this:
